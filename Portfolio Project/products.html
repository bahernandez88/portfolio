                            is pretty good for a change. But now he’s getting more than he bargained for.

                            A duel with the Red Court of Vampires’ champion, who must kill Harry to end the war between
                            vampires and wizards…

                            Professional hit men using Harry for target practice…

                            The missing Shroud of Turin…

                            A handless and headless corpse the Chicago police need identified…

                            Not to mention the return of Harry’s ex-girlfriend Susan, who’s still struggling with her
                            semivampiric nature. And who seems to have a new man in her life.

                            Some days, it just doesn’t pay to get out of bed. No matter how much you’re charging.</td>
